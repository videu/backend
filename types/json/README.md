# JSON Interface Definitions

In this directory are type definitions describing the structure of JSON objects
returned by the `toPublicJSON()` and `toPrivateJSON()` methods found in all
mongoose documents.  All communication with clients is done exclusively over
JSON implementing the structures described in these files.
